# Problem
- An app that removes clothing from the images of women, making them look realistically nude. It uses a photo of a clothed person and creates a new, naked image of that same person.
- There is an app that is easy to use and the images are created a matter of seconds (30 sec).
- The app uses an algorithm (GANs) that is open to the public an every body can recreate.
- invasion of sexual privacy
- Disinformation tool, fake news
- revenge porn

# Solution
- a stamp that says "FAKE" is placed in the upper-left corner (but it can be cropped easily).
- The app was taken down
- Deep Fakes accountability act ( It requires producers of deep fakes to generally comply with certain digital watermark and disclosure requirements and establish criminal offenses if you don't comply)

## Pros
- It slows the propagation of deep fake
## Cons
- Theses aren't enough to stop this technology from hurting real people.

Conclusion
attorney Carrie Goldberg - revenge porn specialist:
"It’s a real bind—deepfakes defy most state revenge porn laws because it’s not the victim’s own nudity depicted, but also our federal laws protect the companies and social media platforms where it proliferates...It’s incumbent on the public to avoid consumption of what we call at my office humili-porn. Whether it’s revenge porn or deepfakes, don’t click or link or share or like! That’s how these sites make money. People need to stop letting their Id drive internet use and use the internet ethically and conscientiously."
